Custom Exporter
===============

# Overview

**Written By:** Jason Wells

This script assists in customizing legal exports.  The script works by first performing a temporary batch export to a specified directory and then renaming the various exported files based on the settings you provide.  An updated version of the DAT file is produced while renaming occurs to contain the update file paths.

# Settings Dialog

When the script is ran a settings dialog will be shown allowing you to configure various aspects of the export customization the script will perform.

When the settings dialog is displayed it will be populated with settings from the previous run (if the script has been ran before).  These settings are stored in the same directory as the script in a file named `RecentSettings.json`.  The script supports saving and loading settings to and from JSON files via the "File" menu.

## Main Tab

- **Export Directory**: Specifies where temporary export will be performed.  Also determines the value of the [Placeholder](#placeholders) `{export_directory}`.
- **Export Metadata As CSV**: When checked metadata loadfile with be exported as CSV in addtion to DAT (which is always exported).
- **Export Metadata As XLSX**: When checked metadata loadfile with be exported as Excel XLSX in addtion to DAT (which is always exported).
  - **Hyperlink to Products in XLSX**: When checked columns containing relative path to exported products (native,text,pdf,tiff) will be hyperlinked.  Clicking hyperlink will open the file pointed to as long as XLSX is properly relative to hyperlinked file.
- **Metadata Profile**: Determines the metadata profile used in the resulting DAT loadfile.  Must contain the field `GUID` which is used to correlate DAT entries back to actual items in the case.  Due to this only metadata profiles which contain the field `GUID` are present in the list.
- **Use Query**: Items exported will be based on a query you provide.
- **Item Query**: The query to use when **Use Query** is checked.
- **Include Families**: When checked, items will be resolved to families before exporting.
- **Use Selected Items**: Uses the items which were selected in the results grid when the script was ran.  If no items were selected this choice will not be available.
- **Use Production Set**: Uses items present in a given production set.  Note that DOCID values in final DAT file will only have meaningful values when this is checked.  Only available when the current case contains at least one production set.
- **Production Set**: The production set to export when **Use Production Set** is checked.

## Nuix DAT Headers

This tab has settings allowing you to specify new header names for some of the DAT columns which Nuix automatically includes during export.

## Text Tab

- **Export Text**: When checked, text files for items will be exported.
- **Text Path Template**: Determines the path and file name of exported text files.  See [Placeholders](#placeholders) for more information.

## Natives Tab

- **Export Natives**: When checked, native files for items will be exported.
- **Natives Path Template**: Determines the path and file name of exported native files.  See [Placeholders](#placeholders) for more information.
- **Email Format**: Specifies the format of exported emails.  Note that currently no mail store formats are supported by this script, only formats which are one email per file.
- **Include Attachments**: If checked, attachments will be left on email messages. If un-checked, attachments will be stripped off.

## PDF Tab

- **Export PDFs**: When checked, PDF files for items will be exported.
- **PDF Path Template**: Determines the path and file name of exported PDF files.  See [Placeholders](#placeholders) for more information.

## TIFF Tab

- **Export TIFFs**: When checked, multi-page TIFF files for items will be exported.
- **Multi-page**/**Single-page**: Whether exported images will be single page or multipage.
- **TIFF Path Template**: Determines the path and file name of exported TIFF files.  See [Placeholders](#placeholders) for more information.
- **TIFF DPI**: DPI resolution of exported images.
- **TIFF Format**: Image format of exported TIFF images.

## Placeholders Tab

Some placeholders are dependent on settings you provide.  These placeholders are configured here.

### Box Placeholder Configuration

Allows you to configure the starting number and 0 pad width of the `{box}` placeholder.  See [General Placeholders](#general-placeholders) for more info.

### Production Set Placeholders

Allows you to configure whether the placeholder `{docid}` is enabled and what production set will be used when resolving document ID values.  These options are only available when the current case contains at least one production set.

### Custom Metadata Placeholder Configuration

This series of combo boxes allow you to configure what custom metadata fields will be used when resolving the [Custom Metadata Placeholders](#custom-metadata-placeholders).

**Note:** These will only show up if the current case contains at least once custom metadata field.

### User Placeholder Configuration

Allows you to define [User Placeholders](#user-placeholders), which are values of your choosing.  May contain most of the other placeholders.

## Filtered Path Name Tab

Allows you to specify mime types to be filtered from the placeholder [Relational Placeholder {filtered_item_path}](#relational-placeholders) or optionally the `Path Name` field in the final DAT file.  Check the mime types of items for which you don't want names included.

- **Modify 'Path Name' in DAT if Present**: When checked and the selected metadata profile contains the field `Path Name`, the `Path Name` field in the final DAT will be updated to reflect the selected filtering.

**Note:** This field is only calculated if the placeholder `{filtered_item_path}` is used or if **Modify 'Path Name' in DAT if Present** is checked.  Calculating filtered path name may incur additional processing time!

## Worker Settings Tab

Allows you to configure worker setttings used by the initial export.

# Placeholders

Placeholders allow you define dynamic pathing and naming based on placeholder values which will be replaced at runtime.  The most basic of which is the placeholder `{export_directory}` which will be replaced with the export directory value specified in the [Main Tab](#main-tab) of the [Settings Dialog](#settings-dialog).

## User Placeholders

These 5 placeholders allow you to specify static values to be replaced when running the script.  The value of these placeholders are specified in the [Placeholders Tab](#palceholders-tab).  These placeholders are evaluated first and may contain any of the other placeholders except `{export_directory}`.

These placeholders are useful if you have defined a common set of settings but have particular values you wish to manually change each time.

- `{user_1}`
- `{user_2}`
- `{user_3}`
- `{user_4}`
- `{user_5}`

**Tip**: These values may contain `\`.

## Custom Metadata Placeholders

These 5 placeholders allow you to select custom metadata fields to be replaced when running the script.  The value of these placeholders are specified in the [Placeholders Tab](#palceholders-tab).  These placeholders are evaluated second and the custom metadata values they point to may contain any of the other placeholders except the [User Placeholders](#user-placeholders).

These placeholders are useful in generating export pathing and naming based on values recorded in custom metadata fields.

- `{custom_1}`
- `{custom_2}`
- `{custom_3}`
- `{custom_4}`
- `{custom_5}`

**Tip**: These values may contain `\`.

## General Placeholders

These placeholders are evaluated after [User Placeholders](#user-placeholders) and [Custom Metadata Placeholders](#custom-metadata-placeholders).  These placeholders mostly represent data about a given item.

**Note:** Since some of these values may contain characters which are illegal file path characters the following characters are replaced with underscores: `<>:"|?*[]`

- `{box}`: This will be replaced with a sequential number which is incremented every `step` items.  `step` being a number you specify in the settings (default is `1000`).  The starting number, `0` pad width and `step` can be defined in the [Placeholders Tab](#palceholders-tab).  **Note:** When the number exceeds the specified width it restarts at `0`!  For example, a width of `4` will roll over to `0` after `9999`.  This placeholder is intended to be used in conjunction with `{box_major}`.
- `{box_major}`: This number increments whenever `{box}` rolls over to `0`.  So for example, if the current item number is `23579` and `{box}` is configured to a width of `4`, `{box_major}` will be `2` (zero padded based on settings) and `{box}` will be `3579`.  Unlike the `{box}` placeholder, if this value exceeds the specified width it does not roll over to `0`.  Therefore it is possible for this number to exceed the width specified if the value contains more digits than the specified width.
- `{name}`: This will be replaced with the item's name, with the extension stripped if present.
- `{fullname}`: Similar to `{name}` this will be replaced with the item's name, but no extension stripping is performed.
- `{guid}`: This will be replaced with the item's GUID.
- `{sub_guid}`: This will be replaced with the first three characters of the item's GUID.  This is useful for creating a GUID based foldering scheme.
- `{md5}`: Replaced with the item's MD5, or `NO_MD5` if the item has no MD5 value.
- `{type}`: Replaced with the item's type name.
- `{mime_type}`: Replaced with the item's mime type.
- `{kind}`: Replaced with the item's kind name.
- `{extension}`: Replaced with the item's type's preferred extension.
- `{custodian}`: Replaced with the item's custodian value if it has one.  If the item does not have a custodian value assigned, this will be replaced with `NO_CUSTODIAN`.
- `{evidence_name}`: Replaced with the name of the evidence item to which the given item belongs.
- `{case_name}`: Replaced with the name of the current case.
- `{item_date}`: Replaced with the item date (without time) formatted using `YYMMDD` such as `20160208`.  If for some reason an item does not have an item date (Item.getDate returns nil) then this will be replaced with the value `00000000`.
- `{item_date_time}`: Replaced with the item date (without time) formatted using `YYMMDD-HHmmss` such as `20170202-130705`.  If for some reason an item does not have an item date (Item.getDate returns nil) then this will be replaced with the value `00000000-000000`.
- `{docid}`: Replaced with a previously assigned DOCID based on a production set selected in the [Placeholders Tab](#placeholders-tab) when **Enable {docid} placeholder** is checked.  Will be replaced with item's GUID if no document ID is able to be found for the given item or no production set is selected on the [Placeholders Tab](#placeholders-tab).
- `{item_path}`: Replaced with a series of directories based on item path names (ex: `Bob_pst\Sent Items\FW_ Some Email`).  If setting **Maximum {item_path} segment length** is set to a number greater than 0 then any given segment longer than that value will be truncated to that value.  If **Maximum {item_path} segment length** is set to 0 (the default) then the script does not enforce any segment length maximum.
- `{filtered_item_path}`: Replaced with a series of directories based on item path names (ex: `Bob_pst\Sent Items\FW_ Some Email`).  Names for items which are of one of the mime types specified in the [Filtered Path Name Tab](#filtered-path-name-tab) will be filtered out from this value.
- `{tags}`: This placeholder will yield the name of each tag applied to the given item.  The tag structure will be turned into directories, for example the tag `Classification|Status|Reviewed` will yield the following in the path `Classification\Status\Reviewed`.  An important feature of this placeholder is that it can yield multiple copies of the same exported product if the item has more than one tag!  Restrict the tags considered for this placeholder by de-selecting them on the `{tags} Placeholder` tab.  If using the `{tags}` placeholder for a template yields multiple copies of a given file, multiple entries will be written in the final DAT file, delimited with `; ` (semicolon space).  If an item has no tags or none of the tags which are checked on the `{tags} Placeholder` tab, this placeholder will yield `No Tags`.
- `{page}`: Replaced with page number (no zero padding).  Only relevant for TIFF pathing template when exporting single page TIFFs.  In all other instances will be replaced with a blank value.  Examples: `DOC0001_1`, `DOC0001_2`, `DOC0001_3`, etc
- `{page_4}`: Replaced with page number zero padded 4 characters wide.  Only relevant for TIFF pathing template when exporting single page TIFFs.  In all other instances will be replaced with a blank value.  Examples: `DOC0001_0001`, `DOC0001_0002`, `DOC0001_0003`, etc

## Relational Placeholders

These placeholders depend on relationships with other items.  These placeholders can be useful to organize exported items based on some relationship, such as grouping items in a directory based on their top level item.

**Note:** When the noted relationship cannot be resolved, the given item will be used instead.

An example of this would be when attempting to resolve the top level item's value for a given item, but the item is above top level.  In this instance the item's value will be used since there is no top level item to resolve against. 

- `{top_level_guid}`: Replaced with the GUID of the item's top level item.
- `{top_level_sub_guid}`: Similar to `{sub_guid}` in [General Placeholders](#general-placeholders), this will be replaced with the first three characters of the top level item's GUID.
- `{top_level_name}`: Similar to `{name}` in [General Placeholders](#general-placeholders), this will be replaced with the name of the top level item, with the extension stripped off if present.
- `{top_level_fullname}`: Similar to `{fullname}` in [General Placeholders](#general-placeholders), this will be replaced with the name of the top level item without the extension stripped off.
- `{top_level_item_path}`: Similar to `{item_path}` in [General Placeholders](#general_placeholders), this will be replaced with a series of directory based on item path names (ex: `Bob_pst\Sent Items\FW_ Some Email`).  The difference is this will be based on the item path of a given item's top level item.
