# Overview

**Written By:** Jason Wells

# Overview

This script assists in customizing legal exports.  The script works by first performing a temporary batch export to a specified directory and then renaming the various exported files based on the settings you provide.  An updated version of the DAT file is produced while renaming occurs to contain the update file paths.

# Getting Started

## Setup

Begin by downloading the latest release.  Extract the contents of the archive into your Nuix scripts directory.  In Windows the script directory is likely going to be either of the following:

- `%appdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - User level script directory
- `%programdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - System level script directory

## Usage
See included [Help](https://github.com/NuixSDK/Custom-Exporter/blob/master/Ruby/CustomExporter.nuixscript/Help.md) file for details on how to use this script.
